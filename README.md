# BulletTrain

BulletTrain is yet another implementation of the well known PE injection technique called "Manual PE Mapping" or "Reflective PE Injection" or whatever name you ever heard where a PE file is manual mapped inside a process and executed.



## Features:

- Map the whole PE inside the process (No PE header erase here)
- IAT parsing 
- Relocations patches
- Works with DLLs and EXEs, as expected


## Example
